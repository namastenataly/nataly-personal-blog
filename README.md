# nataly-personal-blog

## Description 

The goal of this challenge was to create a personal blog to showcase my thoughts and experiences. When you load the app, you are presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content. When you submit the form, the blog post data is stored into localStorage. When the form submits, then you are redirected to the posts page. When you try to submit a form without a username, title, or content, then you are presented with a message that prompts you to complete the form. When you view the posts page, you are presented with a header, a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "back" button. All of these buttons should work accordingly. When you view the main content, you are presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage. When you view localStorage, you are presented with a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content. When you take a closer look at the single blog entry in the list, you can see the title, content, and the author of the post. When you view the footer, you are then presented with a link to the developer's portfolio.
